## 👨‍💻 User Journey

### 1. Registration Process
```
User Input → Aadhaar Verification → OTP Verification → Profile Creation → Account Activation
```

### 2. Document Upload
```
Document Selection → File Validation → Encryption → Category Assignment → Cloud Storage → Metadata Indexing
```

### 3. Document Sharing

    const aadhaarValid = await verifyAadhaar(aadhaarNumber);
    
    // Verify OTP
    const otpValid = await verifyOTP(otp);
    
    if (aadhaarValid && otpValid) {
      return generateSecureToken();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    logSecurityEvent('Authentication failed', error);
    throw new Error('Authentication failed');
  }
}
```
