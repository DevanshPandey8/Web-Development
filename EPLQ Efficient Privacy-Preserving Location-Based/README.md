# EPLQ: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Location-Based Query 🔐📍

An advanced privacy-preserving system for location-based services that enables secure spatial range queries on encrypted data while maintaining user privacy and system efficiency.

## 🎯 Project Overview

EPLQ addresses the critical privacy concerns in location-based services (LBS) by implementing a sophisticated encryption system that allows users to query Points of Interest (POI) within specific geographic areas without revealing their actual location to the service provider.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Queries**: Secure spatial range queries without location disclosure
- **Predicate-Only Encryption**: Advanced encryption for inner product range queries
- **Tree Index Structure**: Optimized data structure for improved query performance
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Fast query generation on Android devices (~0.9 seconds)
- **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient cloud-based POI searching (few seconds on commodity hardware)

## 🛠️ Technologies Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Firebase (Database & Authentication)
- **Security**: Advanced encryption algorithms for location privacy
- **Domain**: Public Safety
- **Difficulty Level**: High
